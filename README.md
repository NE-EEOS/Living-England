# Satellite-based habitat mapping of England in R.

<span>&#9888;</span>  **IMPORTANT** <span>&#9888;</span> 

This repository is currently being updated. This includes changes to the Living England scripts to replace the depreciated *velox* package with *exactextractr* package

The main R file that you need to run the application is livingEngland_classification.r, you will need to provide paths to your datasets within the R script. 
The classification algorithm is the R randomForest package - please see notes about that package online.

livingEngland_classification.r requires the user_producer_accuracy.R and zonal_stats_velox.R scripts to run correctly.

Please let us know if you are using the scripts - drop us a line at earth.observation@naturalengland.org.uk
